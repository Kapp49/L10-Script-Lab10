# L10-Script-Lab10
This script is an updated version of Assignment 6's script.  It is modified to work with professor Usman's CSV file.
The file takes in users and their info from a CSV file and either adds or removes them to Active Directory.
Once can initiate the script by right clicking the file in the GUI or by running it directly through powershell.
